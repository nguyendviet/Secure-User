# Secure User

## Overview
A full stack app that allows users to securely register or sign in then write notes which are saved to its database.

### Why I built this app?
Internet security is a hot topic after recent hacks. I built this app that provides secure password encryption and connections for people so they can sign in and sefely log their travel entries.

### Demo
* Heroku: [Secure User](https://viet-secure-user.herokuapp.com/)

### Logic
* Users register or sign in. App handles cases: unregistered email address, wrong email and password combination...
* Passwords are encrypted before being saved to the database and decrypted to check users' input password when signing in.
* Users' connections are authenticated with tokens (each expires after a few hours) generated by the server and the tokens are decoded each time users makes a request.
* Users can change password or delete account. If users delete their accounts, notes associated with the deleted account will be removed from database.
* Users write new notes and app updates notes instantly from database, shows the previous notes by current user.

## Install
After cloning the repo to your local machine, go to its folder and run:
```
$ npm install --save
```
Next, you need to install mysql2 manually, so run:
```
$ npm install --save mysql2
```
You will also need to make your own keys.js file in folder /config. This is how your keys.js file should look like:
```
module.exports = {secret: 'YOUR OWN KEY HERE'};
```

## Test
Go to folder /test and run:
```
$ mocha <test-file-name>
```
