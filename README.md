### Logic
* User registers or signs in. App handles cases: unregistered email address, wrong email and password combination...
* Password is encrypted before being saved to the database and decrypted to check user's input password when signing in.
* User's connections are authenticated with a token (expires after a few hours) generated by the server and the token is decoded each time user makes a request.
* User can change password or delete account. If user deletes account, old notes will be removed from database.
* User writes new notes and app updates notes instantly from database, shows the previous notes by current user.

## Installation

You will also need to make your own keys.js file in folder /config. This is how your keys.js file should look like:
